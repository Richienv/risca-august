Income and Production Structure

Overview

The business model is built around income duplication and scalable production, supported by mentorship, bonuses, and a community-based system. It allows members to build income streams both from personal production and group performance, with flexible working arrangements and high earning potential.

⸻

Core Concepts
	1.	Income Duplication:
The system allows every producer or builder to replicate their income through team development and mentoring.
	2.	Sales Deal and Commission Setup:
Income is earned through direct personal sales and team (group) production commissions.
	3.	Private Mentorship:
Members receive personalized coaching focused on sales growth, leadership, and production efficiency.
	4.	Flexible and Unlimited Income:
There are no income caps. Income scales with activity, mentorship impact, and team size.
	5.	Double-Digit Monthly Growth:
The system targets consistent double-digit monthly performance improvements.
	6.	Bonus Source Setup:
Several performance-based bonuses are available to reward both short-term and long-term achievements.
	7.	Tier System (2–3× Level Multiplier):
A multi-tier compensation structure that multiplies income 2–3× per level, used across London, Singapore, and Taiwan.
	8.	Free Perks and Memberships:
Members gain access to free events, training, or platform privileges.
	9.	100 Million Loan Facility:
A special financing or credit support of up to 100 million for qualified members to scale their business.
	10.	Growth Community:
A collaborative ecosystem designed to help members accelerate performance through shared best practices.

Income Flow and Production Calculation

Example Scenario (Base Case)
	•	Personal Production: 300 units
	•	Basic Ratio: 1 (Producer) : 4 (Builder)
	•	Conversion to APE (Active Production Equivalent): 1 project = 1.8 APE
	•	Core Producer Output: 300 units × 25% = 75 units

Breakdown of Personal Production (Total = 306 jt)

Item	Description	Value
Personal Income	Direct sales-based earnings	75 jt
Bonus Production	Tier-based bonus from performance	22.5 jt
PPD (Performance Point Distribution)	Additional income from milestones	5 jt
Mentorship Bonus	Incentive for supporting new producers	5 jt
Total Monthly Production	~27.5 jt per cycle	
Annual Income Projection	27.5 jt × 12 months = 306 jt	


⸻

Bonus and Ratio System
	•	Each producer can generate about 300 units of personal production.
	•	The group structure includes 1 Core Producer mentoring 4 builders (1:4 ratio).
	•	The system scales through duplication — each new builder generates proportional APE output.

Example: Bonus Distribution
	•	200 total APE
	•	Producer share = 25% → 50 jt
	•	Builder share (4:1 ratio) → 75 jt
	•	Tier Gain = 13 levels deep (3–20.5% bonus progression)

Tier	Gain (%)	Description
1–3	3–8%	Entry-level productivity gain
4–10	10–20%	Mid-level active producers
11–13	20.5%	Top-tier performers

Tier Gain Formula Example:
200 APE × 25% × 20.5% = 10.25 APE equivalent (bonus added to total income)

⸻

Group Production (Case 2)

When operating as a team or organization:
	•	Total Group Production: 1.26 billion (combined)
	•	Group Ratio: 4 : 1 (Producer to Builder)
	•	Bonus Case: 10 APE average per team
	•	Production Distribution: 75% allocated to active agents
	•	Total Agents: Approx. 20 in each active cluster

Group Income Calculation:
	•	Each agent contributes ~250 APE
	•	250 × 25% × 20.5% = 12.81 jt average bonus per agent
	•	Total group-level production = 20 agents × 12.81 jt = 256.2 jt group value

⸻

Combined Income Potential

Source	Value (jt)	Description
Personal Income	125 jt	From individual sales & bonuses
Group Income	151.5 jt	From team and downline performance
Total Combined Annual Income	276.5 jt	Scalable, recurring, performance-based


⸻

Implementation Highlights
	•	Average agent handles 8–15 applications weekly.
	•	Minimum group case completion: 7 October (15 applications).
	•	Constant training and coaching ensure performance growth across the network.
	•	Emphasis on realistic, incremental results rather than disruptive methods.

⸻

Summary

This structure provides a hybrid income model that combines:
	•	Personal sales performance
	•	Group productivity
	•	Tiered growth bonuses
	•	Replication through mentorship

It allows agents or partners to achieve sustainable, compounding income growth through well-tracked production systems, mentorship incentives, and scalable financing access. The model supports flexibility, leadership development, and measurable financial expansion.
